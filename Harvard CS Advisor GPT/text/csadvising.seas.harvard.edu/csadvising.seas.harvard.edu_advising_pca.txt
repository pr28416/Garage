Concentration: Computer Science & English with a secondary in Spanish
Courses:  CS20, CS50, CS51, CS109A

About Me:   Hi y’all!! I’m a senior in Adams from Fort Worth, TX. I’m studying Statistics/Computer Science with a secondary in Educational Studies. I’m interested in using CS and Statistics in housing, immigration, or education policy research. Outside of class, I work as a CA/TF and am involved with PBHA (Summer Urban Program, Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment, and Harvard Square Homeless Shelter) and the Noteables. I’m excited to meet y’all – please reach out about any of the above, or anything else on your mind. I came to college with little experience/interest in CS and sought advice from a lot of people in SEAS, so nothing is too big or small!!
