Tag Definitions
Core CS
Courses that count towards the Computer Science core requirements.
Programming 1 and 2
A Programming course must include significant software construction and good engineering practice (e.g., invariants, assertions, testing).
Formal Reasoning
A Formal Reasoning course should include significant formal reasoning about computer science as an integral part of the course material and student work. Such a course should define properties of some computational entities (e.g., computers, functional programming languages, auctions) and prove statements that apply to every entity with those properties. Formal reasoning courses instill in students the formal habits of mind that are central to academic computer science.
Computational Limitations
A Computational Limitations course covers basic computability and complexity theory. It exposes students to the beautiful results concerning the fundamental limits of universal (Turing-complete) model of computation, the equivalence of different computational models, and the impossibility or infeasibility of computing certain functions.
All Computational Limitations courses are also Formal Reasoning courses. The prototypical Computational Limitations courses are CS 120 and CS 121.
Algorithms
An Algorithms course covers introductory algorithms, algorithmic analysis, and data structures. It exposes students to fundamental algorithms for problems involving topics such as sorting, searching, and graphs, and to the basic toolkit for algorithmic analysis, such as recurrences for runtime.
All Algorithms courses are also Formal Reasoning courses. The prototypical Algorithms courses are CS 120 and CS 124.
Intermediate Algorithms
An Intermediate Algorithms course, like an Algorithms course, covers algorithms, algorithmic analysis, data structures, and algorithmic analysis, but at a greater level of sophistication and covering more ground.
Intermediate Algorithms courses are also Formal Reasoning courses and Algorithms courses. The prototypical Intermediate Algorithms course is CS 124. Our honors requirements mention Intermediate Algorithms instead of Algorithms. We assume that a good fraction of honors students will take CS 120 and CS 124, and a good fraction will take CS 121 and CS 124.
Systems
A systems course should feature significant computer system development, i.e., the development of systems where interaction with and adaptation to other software or hardware interfaces is an important concern. Systems courses require that students complete extensive programming or computer system development assignments on their own or in small groups. These assignments must be in part open-ended and require the design of software or hardware components. Assignments must involve adapting to existing interfaces, and concern for performance, robustness, and/or security. Many systems courses will also satisfy a Programming tag.
Computation and the World
A Computation and the World course should introduce rigorous methods for developing and evaluating computational models and systems that encapsulate, interact with, and adapt to aspects of the empirical world. This often involves computational modeling, or the distilled expression of properties of the complex world—of natural, human, social, and informational systems—in terms amenable to computation, and the formulation of computational objectives to capture positive interventions in that world. Ideally, Computation and the World courses should give students tools and metrics for constructing their own models and objectives, as well as specific ones that apply to specific phenomena. Discretion, selection, and design are fundamental to these courses (modeling complex systems in computation, or designing systems that interact with humans or the world, rarely has one right answer).
Artificial Intelligence
An Artificial Intelligence course should introduce, motivate, and analyze tools and techniques to model or replicate behaviors that in humans are thought of as requiring or exhibiting intelligence. These behaviors include representation of knowledge, reasoning, planning, language use, and sensory interpretation.
Most Artificial Intelligence courses are also Computation and the World courses, human behaviors being aspects of the empirical world. However, some AI courses that do not focus on the discretion, selection, design, and interaction fundamental to Computation and the World might not fulfill the corresponding tag. (Such courses might focus, instead, on mathematical foundations.)
Advanced Computer Science
An Advanced Computer Science course should correspond to computer science courses at an advanced undergraduate level or above (typically corresponding to courses with a course number CS 100 or above).
