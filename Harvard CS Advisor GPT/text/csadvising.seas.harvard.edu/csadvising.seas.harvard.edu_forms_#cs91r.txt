              Forms
            
Plan of Study Form
Students intending to declare the CS concentration must submit a CS plan
of study form. Prior to graduation, seniors must update the form to
ensure CS concentration requirements have been fulfilled. In both cases,
students should fill out the form and email it
to cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu for verification. See also Concentration information.


Plan of Study  (Microsoft Excel) version 1.0.8. When you fill out the plan of study, use the  SEAS 4-year plan to verify that the courses you are planning to take in particular term are actually slated to be offered that term. Please submit this form as an Excel document (preferred) or as a PDF. The form does not work properly as a Numbers Document. You can use Excel for free as a Harvard Student.


Plan of Study old (2020 and earlier) Requirements (Microsoft Excel) version 1.2.4. This spreadsheet is for students who completed at least one term in the college prior to Fall 2021 and choose to follow the old (2020 and earlier) requirements. Please submit this form as an Excel document (preferred) or as a PDF. The form does not work properly as a Numbers Document. You can use Excel for free as a Harvard Student.


CS 91r Form
Students wishing to take a CS 91r must follow the instructions on the
form below to get approval from your research advisor and the Director
of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to enroll in the course. (The DUS is the
official instructor for CS91r, not your research advisor.)

CS 91r form Version 1.3: note that your advisor should email this form to cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu


Advisor request form
Fill in the online advisor request form when you
declare a CS concentration to request a particular advisor, or to
request to change advisors.
