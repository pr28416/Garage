              Joint, double and combined concentrations
            
There are several ways to combine other interests with computer science.
Electives
Even if you are in an Honors program, a significant portion of your coursework
is purely elective, meaning available for whatever courses you choose (rather
than dedicated to CS or General Education requirements). Take interesting
courses—that’s what college is for! Not all your interests need to be reflected
in your official degree program.
Secondary Fields
A lightweight way of getting official recognition within Harvard for work in
two fields is to do one or the other as a secondary field. This generally
involves taking 4 or 5 courses in the secondary field. Secondary fields appear
on your transcript, but not your diploma.

About secondary fields (Harvard Student Handbook)
List of secondary fields (Harvard Student Handbook)
Requirements for a secondary field in computer science (4 courses)

Joint Concentrations
Students with serious interests in both computer science and a related
concentration—one that is either foundational to the study of computing, or
where computing is being applied in significant ways—may pursue a joint
concentration between the two. This is not a “double major”: the two fields
must overlap, and the student must write a senior thesis acceptable to both
concentrations. Computer science has had successful joint concentrators with
engineering, social sciences, natural sciences, and the humanities.
Compared to the basic CS track, joint concentrators may take fewer
Core Computer Science classes, and may use CS 91r to satisfy some CS
requirements, but must write a thesis.

Joint concentrations in general (Harvard Student Handbook)
Computer science joint concentration requirements

Students are responsible for ensuring that their degree program meets all
deadlines and requirements of both concentrations. CS allows courses to count
towards the requirements of both concentrations, but some other concentrations
do not. We advise all our joint concentrators to satisfy the basic
requirements for at least one of their concentrations, in case they do not
complete a thesis. Students considering a joint concentration should consult
the DUS team early to plan their courses, and consider whether a
secondary field or elective would better meet their needs.
Joint concentrations are honors-track programs. Each
field recommends honors separately, and in most circumstances the minimum
recommendation takes precedence. The primary field (the first-listed
concentration) is ultimately responsible for the English honors
recommendation, however.
Double Concentrations
Students with serious interests in both computer science and any concentration, not necessarily related,
may pursue a double
concentration of the two. This is a “double major”: the student must fulfill
all the requirements for both a CS concentration (regular, honors, or MBB) and
their other concentration, and at most two courses may be counted toward both concentrations.
Students are responsible for ensuring that their degree program meets all
deadlines and requirements of both concentrations. The (regular, honors, or MBB) CS side of
a double concentration is equivalent in course requirements and honors to a (regular, honors, or MBB) concentration.
The Mind, Brain, and Behavior (MBB) Program
Students interested in addressing questions of neuroscience and cognition from
the perspective of computer science may pursue a special program of study
affiliated with the University-wide Mind, Brain, and Behavior
Initiative. This honors-track program allows
students to participate in a variety of related activities. Similar programs
are available through the Anthropology, History and Science, Human
Evolutionary Biology, Linguistics, Neurooscience, Philosophy, and Psychology
concentrations.

Frequently Asked Questions about the MBB track

Electrical and Computer Engineering
If you want to study hardware (e.g., chips, circuits, and memory) as
well as software, consider pursuing the Electrical and Computer
Engineering
track
as part of the Engineering Sciences concentration. This is distinct
from, but parallel to, the Computer Science concentration.
Additional Advice
The Peer Concentration Advisors have compiled the CS Interdisciplinary Paths Unofficial Guide, a resource that contains further advice on combining computer science with other fields, including sample plans of study and specific courses that may be of interest.
