              Sample schedules and plans of study
            
Here are some suggested paths for the the Computer Science concentration based on the new (Fall 2021) concentration requirements. These are just examples: there are many possible pathways through the degree. Interested students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies for guidance.
We recommend students also look at our unofficial guides in the resources page, as well as talk to one of our peer concentration advisors.
Plenty of other combinations are possible! 
First year


Fall: CS 50 (fulfills programming 1) and one of Applied Math 22a Solving and Optimizing or  Math 23a/22a/21b/25a/55a: Linear Algebra (fulfills linear algebra). (See this pamphlet by the math department on the difference between the various courses.)


Spring:  CS 32 or CS 50 Spring if you did not take CS 50 in the fall. Otherwise, take CS 51 (fulfills programming 2). We also recommend to take  CS 20 (fulfills discrete mathematics and one of three formal reasoning courses).


Notes:


If you do not place out, you need to take Math Ma/Mb/1a/1b before linear algebra.


If you have significant CS experience and decide to skip CS 50, you can take either CS 61, or CS 120/CS 121 (depending whether your strengths are more in systems programming or mathematics) in the fall.


If you are  comfortable with mathematical proofs, you may be able to skip CS 20.  The CS 121 background page  can help you decide if that’s the case.


You can also choose to take CS 61 as your second programming course in your sophomore fall, or defer CS 51 to sophomore spring.


Sophomore year


Fall: Take either CS 121 or CS 120. Both count as formal reasoning courses, and also fulfill the computational limitations tag. CS 120 also fulfills the algorithms tag. We also recommend students take STAT 110, which fulfills the statistics/probability tag.  Another potential course to take is CS 61 that fulfills the programming 2 and systems tags.


Spring: CS 124 which counts as a formal reasoning course and also fulfills the intermediate algorithms tag. Intermediate algorithms is recommended for all concentrators, and is required for the honors track. You can also take CS 51  (if didn’t take it before)  or a different CS technical elective.


Junior and senior year
Take electives per your interests. You might also want to consider pursuing a research project via CS 91r. You can also explore taking courses at MIT that pique your interest.
Some sample schedules
Here are some example plans that  are meant to be examples of ways to meet the requirements. However, students do not have to follow any of these plans, and are free to make their own plan of study as long as it satisfies the requirements. None of the plans below requires more than two concentration courses per semester. With careful planning, a student can start in Math Ma and complete an honors plan with 2 concentration courses per semester.  For more examples, please check out our GoogleSheet. Each tab is a different plan (Basic, Honors, Joint, MBB). While we offer several examples, please know that you are welcome to speak with an advisor about your specific situation.
