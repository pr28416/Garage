              Cross-registering at MIT
            
Harvard students can cross register for courses at MIT.
The following pages can be useful in how to do so:


This MIT page with instructions for Harvard students


Registrar’s office cross-registration dates and overview for Harvard College Students. Dates are available in the my.harvard course catalog.


This Harvard page on cross-registering Please note that the Harvard Course Catalog places a space in MIT course numbers before the decimal–e.g. “6 .5900”


Step-by-Step Instructions on Cross-Registration


Graduating Seniors Probably Shouldn’t Cross Register


You should also talk to your resident dean to make sure the process goes smoothly.
Some MIT courses can count towards the 2020 Computer Science concentration as shown on this table. Courses for the 2021 are currently approved on an individual basis but some that have been approved are listed our our course tags table.
If you want to use a course listed on the above table for concentration credit, please email cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu with your updated plan of study and submit the
‘Concentration Credit for Cross Registered course’ form to the registrar’s office.
This form is due by the 5th Monday of the term you take the course or the 5th Monday of the semester following the semester you declare your concentration.
If you want to petition for counting a course that is not listed in the table, email cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu with the syllabus of the course, any other information, and what requirement would you like it to count for (e.g., elective, breadth, theory, math, etc.). Please leave up to two weeks for the DUS team to make a decision in consultation with our colleagues.
If the petition is approved then you should submit an updated plan of study and the form above.
The grades for cross registered courses are included in the transcript, and if they are used for concentration credit then they are used in calculating the overall and concentration GPA as well.
More information on the grading policy of cross-registered courses is available in the Handbook.
A tip on getting to MIT:  The LMA M2 shuttle  is free with a Harvard ID. You can also use the T (red line), a bus (the MBTA 1), or a Blue Bike.
