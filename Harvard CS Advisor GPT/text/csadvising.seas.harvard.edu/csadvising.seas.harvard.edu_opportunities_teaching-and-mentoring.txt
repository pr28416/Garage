              Teaching and advising
            
Computer Science students have a number of opportunities to be teachers
and mentors for their fellow students. 
Peer Concentration Advisors (PCAs)
PCAs are peer advisors for current CS concentrators and
pre-concentrators, providing a valuable perspective and helping direct
students to additional resources. More information on the Peer Concentration Advisors page.
Alex Patel Teaching Fellows
The Alex Patel Teaching Fellowships are prestigious fellowships awarded
to students to provide one-on-one tutoring in Computer Science courses.
Please see this page for
more details.
Teaching Fellows and Course Assistants
If you are interested in being a Teaching Fellow (TF) or Course
Assistant (CA) for a Computer Science course, look for an email to the
cs-undergrads@seas.harvard.edu mailing list requesting applications.
Also feel free to directly contact the instructor. If you have a strong
interest in or understanding of the course material (for example, if you
took the course and received an A- or an A) we encourage you to apply!
Peer Tutoring at the Academic Resource Center
Peer tutoring is an opportunity for you to connect with a fellow student either to get help with your courses or to provide assistance in courses in which you have previously done well. Academic Resource Center (ARC) Peer Tutors are paid hourly for their time. The ARC connects Harvard students with a network of trained peers who can support their learning. Peer Tutors can provide an extra layer of academic support for students by reviewing critical concepts and materials from class, clarifying points of confusion, and developing study strategies for upcoming exams.
Computer Science Peer Tutors are in high demand! You can be a Peer Tutor in a course if you received an A- or higher. If you are a TF/CA for a course, it may still be possible for you to also be a Peer Tutor for the course.
For more information, including how to register as a Peer Tutor, see https://academicresourcecenter.harvard.edu/peer-tutoring.
Community groups
Many student-run groups provide an opportunity to teach and mentor
fellow College students and members of the broader community. See the
Student Organizations page
for links to these groups.
