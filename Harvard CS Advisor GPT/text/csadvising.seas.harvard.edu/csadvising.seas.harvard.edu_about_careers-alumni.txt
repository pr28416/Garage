              Careers of alumni
            
What can you do with a degree in Computer Science? Some computer science
graduates have moved into industry (as programmers) or entered graduate
programs (from applied sciences to medicine to law).
Still others have pursued entrepreneurial/business routes, found a home
in the evolving world of digital media, or used their computational
skills to move into finance, banking, or health care.
Put simply, computer science serves as an entryway into just about every
scientific and business-related field, and increasingly acts as an
accelerator for success in academia and industry.
In fact, our alumni have been going into so many different fields and areas, that we find it difficult to keep up with them and maintain this page…
Careers By Area
“I found that being around so many intelligent and motivated people
inspired me to think very big about what I wanted to do in my own
life." Danielle Feinberg ‘96, Pixar
Some examples of areas you can explore are


Artificial Intelligence:  Develop computers that simulate human learning and reasoning ability.


Computer Architecture: Design new components and systems for everything from high-performance,
networked parallel machines to low-cost and lowpower iPods.


Computer Design and Engineering: Design new computer circuits, microchips, and other electronic
components.


Theoretical Computer Science: Investigate the fundamental theories of how computers solve problems,
and apply the results to other areas of computer science.


Information Technology: Develop and manage information systems that support a business or
organization.


Operating Systems and Networks: Develop the basic software that computers use to supervise themselves or
to communicate with other computers.


Software Applications: Apply computing and technology to solving problems outside the computer
field - in education or medicine, for example.


Software Engineering: Develop methods for the production of software systems on time, within budget


Occupations post graduations
The following is a table of where our students go post graduation, though it’s hard to keep this table updates as career options for CS graduates keep expanding!

Alumni Stories
Salil Vadhan ‘95

Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics,
Harvard University
After completing his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer
Science at Harvard, Salil Vadhan received a C.A.S. in Mathematics from
Cambridge University (1996) and then went on to earn his Ph.D. in
Applied Mathematics at MIT (1999).
His primary research interests are in computational complexity theory,
cryptography, randomness in computation, and the interplay between these
areas.
Gary Schermerhorn ’85

Co-Chief Operating Officer for the Technology Division of Goldman
Sachs, with operational oversight of the division’s business units*
Schermerhorn
joined Goldman Sachs (in Equity Systems) in New York in 1990, and has
headed technology for the NASDAQ Business Group as well as the Asset
Management Group.
He became a managing director in 1998 and a partner in 2000. In addition
to gaining a lifelong friendship with Harvard College Professor Harry
Lewis, Schermerhorn also met his wife, Miriam Esteve ‘85 (Applied Math),
at Harvard. She now serves as Head of Operations and Technology for the
Global Wealth Management Division of Citigroup.
Danielle Feinberg ‘96

Lead lighting artist at Pixar Animation Studios
As lead lighting artist at Pixar Animation Studios,
Feinberg
led the team that rendered the aquatic universe in Finding Nemo, from
the surge and swell of plant life to the bounce and pop of billions of
bubbles. Her exposure to computer graphics began at age eight with
designing spirographs in LOGO.
Today she has a list of future classics to her credit, including A
Bug’s Life; Toy Story 2; Monsters, Inc.; and most recently, The
Incredibles and WAL-E.
