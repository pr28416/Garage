If you are interested in exploring opportunities for creating or marketing projects or startups,
you might find the resources below useful. In addition, we encourage you to  talk to your faculty advisor about your plans- even if they don’t know all the answers to your questions, they will often be able to suggest someone who does.


The SEAS Entrepreneurship Website offers many resources for students.


The Harvard Innovation Lab is a “one stop shop” for advice, events courses, and networking that many students find very useful.


Harvard StartupTree is a platform to help social innovators find relevant teammates, funding, resources, and events across Harvard and MIT. This network is exclusive for Harvard and MIT students and alumni.


Harvard College Ventures is a student-run entrepreneurship and venture capital organization.


The law school’s Cyberlaw clinic can also sometimes provide legal advice and services for students who are interested in starting a project or a company. Even when they can’t take you as a client, they will usually give you some excellent referrals.


Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows Program Made possible by a generous gift from the Roberts Family Foundation, the Fellows program enables a group of 10-15 outstanding Harvard College sophomores and juniors (from any College concentration) to build knowledge, skills, and a community, putting them on a path to launch and lead innovative endeavors – whether this be creating technology startups or leading innovation teams in governmental or non-profit/social organizations. Selected students are known as the Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows.


Lemann Program on Creativity & Entrepreneurship (LPCE) is based at the Office of Undergraduate Education, and we prepare Harvard students to take the lead in solving global challenges by fostering entrepreneurial thinking within liberal arts education. Our students develop venture projects that address challenges related to global health, climate change, or social justice. For more information, please visit lpce.college.harvard.edu.


Harvard Technology and Entrepreneurship center. As part of this center, ES 95: Startup R&D is a course aimed at giving students “actual experience as a founder of a startup, whether commercial, social or another type of innovative project.”


Professor Josh Lerner’s course ES 94: Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Practical and Academic Insights. This course aims to provide for undergraduates an introduction to entrepreneurship and its implications for innovation. The class will primarily consist of case study discussions, but will include some traditional lecture sessions that built on academic papers to provide more frameworks. As such, it draws primarily on materials from the introductory MBA course at Harvard Business School, “The Entrepreneurial Manager” (TEM).


Harvard’s office of career website lists various events and programs aimed at start-ups and entrepreneurship.
