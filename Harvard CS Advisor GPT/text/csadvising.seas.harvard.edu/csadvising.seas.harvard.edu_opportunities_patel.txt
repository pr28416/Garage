              Alex Patel Fellowship
            
Alex Patel Teaching Fellowships are a prestigious fellowship awarded to
Harvard students (undergraduate and graduate) to provide up to 12 hours
per week of one-on-one tutoring in Computer Science courses.

Alex H. Patel exemplified the commitment and devotion of
students-helping-students, as a teaching fellow, a classmate, and a
friend. In his honor, the Patel Family created a program that keeps his
spirit alive through the support offered to students studying Computer
Science.
The Fellows help students for whom the normal course support channels
are insufficient: students who need tutoring, not simply answers to
questions. Fellows are assigned to appropriate Computer Science
courses and augment course staff by providing individual tutoring to
students. Although the Fellows are part of the course staff, they do
not participate in grading, section, or regular office hours; instead
they focus their time on providing one-on-one tutoring.  Fellows also
register as Computer Science tutors with the Academic Resource Center
(ARC) if they wish to tutor more than the twelve hours. If hired as
ARC Peer Tutors, Fellows will be required to attend ARC trainings and
will be paid hourly by the ARC.
The Alex Patel fellows form a cohort with access to special
opportunities around teaching, including, Computer Science faculty
meetings at least once per semester, regular meetings with instructional
staff in Computer Science and other professional development
opportunities.
Patel Fellows are selected by a committee comprising the current
Fellows, the Directors of Undergraduate Studies, and faculty teaching
the courses in greatest need of tutoring services.
If you are interested in being an Alex Patel Teaching Fellow, please
contact the Directors of Undergraduate Studies. If you are student in a
course with a Fellow and would like one-on-one tutoring, please contact
the Fellow directly.
