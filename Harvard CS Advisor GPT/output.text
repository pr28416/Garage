interested in exploring opportunities for creating or marketing projects or startups,\nyou might find the resources below useful. In addition, we encourage you to  talk to your faculty advisor about your plans- even if they don’t know all the answers to your questions, they will often be able to suggest someone who does.\n\n\nThe SEAS Entrepreneurship Website offers many resources for students.\n\n\nThe Harvard Innovation Lab is a “one stop shop” for advice, events courses, and networking that many students find very useful.\n\n\nHarvard StartupTree is a platform to help social innovators find relevant teammates, funding, resources, and events across Harvard and MIT. This network is exclusive for Harvard and MIT students and alumni.\n\n\nHarvard College Ventures is a student-run entrepreneurship and venture capital organization.\n\n\nThe law school’s Cyberlaw clinic can also sometimes provide legal advice and services for students who are interested in starting a project or a company. Even when they can’t take you as a client, they will usually give you some excellent referrals.\n\n\nUndergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows Program Made possible by a generous gift from the Roberts Family Foundation, the Fellows program enables a group of 10-15 outstanding Harvard College sophomores and juniors (from any College concentration) to build knowledge, skills, and a community, putting them on a path to launch and lead innovative endeavors – whether this be creating technology startups or leading innovation teams in governmental or non-profit/social organizations. Selected students are known as the Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows.\n\n\nLemann Program on Creativity & Entrepreneurship (LPCE) is based at the Office of Undergraduate Education, and we prepare Harvard students to take the lead in solving global challenges by fostering entrepreneurial thinking within liberal arts education. Our students develop venture projects that address challenges related to global health, climate change, or social justice.

As part of this center, ES 95: Startup R&D is a course aimed at giving students “actual experience as a founder of a startup, whether commercial, social or another type of innovative project.”\n\n\nProfessor Josh Lerner’s course ES 94: Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Practical and Academic Insights. This course aims to provide for undergraduates an introduction to entrepreneurship and its implications for innovation. The class will primarily consist of case study discussions, but will include some traditional lecture sessions that built on academic papers to provide more frameworks. As such, it draws primarily on materials from the introductory MBA course at Harvard Business School, “The Entrepreneurial Manager” (TEM).\n\n\nHarvard’s office of career website lists various events and programs aimed at start-ups and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard John A.

write-up. It is documentation\nof an attempt to contribute to the general understanding of some problem\nof computer science, together with exposition that sets the work in the\ncontext of what has come before and what might follow. In computer\nscience, some theses involve building systems, some involve experiments\nand measurements, some are theoretical, some involve human subjects, and\nsome do more than one of these things. Computer science is unusual among\nscientific disciplines in that current faculty research has many loose\nends appropriate for undergraduate research.\nSenior thesis projects generally emerge from collaboration with faculty.\nStudents looking for senior thesis projects should tell professors they\nknow, especially professors whose courses they are taking or have taken,\nthat they are looking for things to work on. See the page on CS\nResearch for Undergrads. Ideas\noften emerge from recent papers discussed in advanced courses. The terms\nin which some published research was undertaken might be generalized,\nrelaxed, restricted, or applied in a different domain to see if changed\nassumptions result in a changed solution. Once a project gets going, it\noften seems to assume a life of its own.\nTo write a thesis, students may enroll in Computer Science 91r one or\nboth terms during their senior year, under the supervision of their\nresearch advisor.  Rising seniors may\nwish to begin thinking about theses over the previous summer, and\ntherefore may want to begin their conversations with faculty during\ntheir junior spring—or even try to stay in Cambridge to do summer\nresearch.\nAn information session for those interested in writing a senior thesis\nis held towards the end of each spring semester. Details about the\nsession will be posted to\nthe cs-undergrads@seas.harvard.edu\nemail list.\nStudents interested in commercializing ideas in their theses may wish to\nconsult Executive Dean Fawwaz Habbal about patent protection.\nSee Harvard’s\npolicy for\ninformation about ownership of software written as part of your academic\nwork.\nThesis Supervisor\nYou need a thesis supervisor. Normally this is a Harvard Computer Science\nfaculty member. Joint concentrators (and, in some cases, non-joint\nconcentrators) might have a FAS/SEAS Faculty member from a different field as\ntheir thesis supervisor. Exceptions to the requirement that the thesis\nsupervisor is a CS or FAS/SEAS faculty member must be approved by the\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies. For students whose advisor is not a\nHarvard CS faculty member, note that at least one of your thesis readers must be\na Harvard CS faculty member, and we encourage you to talk with this faculty\nmember regularly to help ensure that your thesis is appropriately\nrelevant for Harvard Computer Science.\nIt’s up to you and your supervisor how frequently you meet and how\nengaged the supervisor is in your thesis research. However, we encourage\nyou to meet with your supervisor at least several times during the Fall\nand Spring, and to agree on deadlines for initial results, chapter\noutlines, drafts, etc.\nThesis Readers\nThe thesis is evaluated by the thesis readers. Thesis readers must be either:\n\n\nTwo Harvard CS faculty members/affiliates; or:\n\n\nThree readers, at least one of whom is a Harvard CS faculty member and the others are ordinarily teaching faculty members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences or SEAS who are generally familiar with the research area.\n\n\nThe thesis supervisor is one of the readers.\nThe student is responsible for finding the other readers, but you can talk with your supervisor for suggestions of possible readers.\nExceptions to these thesis reader requirements must be approved by the Directors\nof Undergraduate Studies.\nFor joint concentrators, the other concentration may have different procedures for thesis readers; if you have any questions or concerns about thesis readers, please contact the Directors of Undergraduate Studies.\nSenior Thesis Seminar\nComputer Science does not have a Senior Thesis seminar course.\nHowever, we do run an informal optional series of Senior Thesis meetings in the Fall to help with the thesis writing process, focused on topics such as technical writing tips, work-shopping your senior thesis story, structure of your thesis, and more. Pay attention to your email in the Fall for announcements about this series of meetings.\nFormat\nThe thesis should contain an informative abstract separate from the body\nof the thesis. This abstract should clearly state what the contribution\nof the thesis is–which parts are expository, whether there are novel results, etc.\nWe also recommend the thesis contain an introduction that is at most 5 pages in length that\ncontains an “Our contributions” section which explains exactly what the thesis contributed,\nand which sections in the thesis these are elaborated on.\nAt the degree meeting, the Committee on Undergraduate\nStudies in Computer Science will review the thesis abstract, the reports\nfrom the three readers and the student’s academic record; it will have\naccess to the thesis.  The readers (and student) are told to assume that\nthe Committee consists of technical professionals who are not\nnecessarily conversant with the subject matter of the thesis so their\nreports (and abstract) should reflect this audience.\nThe length of the thesis should be as long as it needs to be to present\nits arguments, but no longer!\nThere are no specific formatting guidelines. For LaTeX, some students have used this template in the past. It is set up to meet the Harvard PhD Dissertation requirements, so it is meeting requirements that you as CS Senior Thesis writers don’t have.\nThesis Timeline for Seniors\n(The timeline below is for students graduating in May. For off-cycle students, the same timeline applies, but offset by one semester. The thesis due date for March 2024 graduates is Friday November 17, 2023 at 4pm. The thesis deadline for May 2023 graduates is Friday March 24th at 4pm.\nPlease be aware that students writing a joint thesis must meet the requirements of both departments–so if there are two different due dates for the thesis, you are expected to meet the earlier date.\nSenior Fall (or earlier)\nFind a thesis supervisor, and start research. \nOctober/November/December\nStart writing.\nAll fourth year concentrators are contacted by the Office of Academic\nPrograms and those planning to submit a senior thesis are requested to\nsupply certain information, including name of advisor and a tentative thesis title. You may use a different title when you submit your thesis; you do not need to tell us your updated title before then.\nIf Fall 2023 is your final term, please fill out this form.\nFor May 2023 degree candidates, please fill out this form.\nEarly February\nThe student should provide the name and contact information\nfor the readers (see above), together with assurance that they have\nagreed to serve. \nMid-March\nThesis supervisors are advised to demand a first draft. (A common\nreaction of thesis readers is “This would have been an excellent first\ndraft. Too bad it is the final thesis—it could have been so much\nbetter if I had been able to make some suggestions a couple of weeks\nago.")\nMarch 24, 2023\nThesis is due by 4:00 pm. Electronic copies in PDF format should be\ndelivered by the student to all three readers and to\ncs-submit@seas.harvard.edu (which will forward to the Director of\nUndergraduate Studies) on or before that date. An electronic copy should\nalso be submitted via the SEAS online submission\ntool on or before that date. SEAS\nwill keep this electronic copy as a non-circulating backup. During this online submission process, the student\nwill also have the option to make the electronic copy publicly available\nvia DASH, Harvard’s open-access repository for scholarly work. Please note that the thesis will NOT be published to ProQuest. More\ninformation can be found on the SEAS Senior Thesis\nSubmission page.\nThe two or three readers will receive a rating sheet to be returned to the\nOffice of Academic Programs before the beginning of the Reading Period,\ntogether with their copy of the thesis and any remarks to be transmitted\nto the student.\nLate May\nThe student may pick up the reader’s comments and thesis copies from the\nOffice of Academic Programs, after the degree meeting to decide honors\nrecommendations.\nThesis Extensions and Late Submissions\nThesis extensions\nThesis extensions will be granted in extraordinary circumstances, such as hospitalization or grave family emergency, with the support of the thesis advisor and resident dean and the agreement of all readers. For joint concentrators, the other concentration should also support the extension. To request an extension, please have your advisor or resident dean email cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu, ideally several business days in advance, so that we may follow up with readers. Please note that any extension must be able to fall within our normal grading, feedback, and degree recommendation deadline, so extensions of more than a few days are usually impossible.\nLate submissions\nLate submission of thesis work should be avoided. Work that is late will ordinarily not be eligible for thesis prizes like the Hoopes Prize. Theses submitted late will ordinarily be penalized one full level of honors (highest honors, high honors, honors, no honors) per day late or part thereof, including weekends, so a thesis submitted two days and one minute late is ordinarily ineligible to receive honors.\nPenalties will be waived only in extraordinary cases, such as documented medical illness or grave family emergency; students should consult with the Directors of Undergraduate Studies in that event. Missed alarm clocks, crashed computers, slow printers, corrupted files, and paper jams are not considered valid causes for extensions.\nThesis Examples\nRecent thesis examples can be found on the Harvard DASH (Digital Access to\nScholarship at Harvard) repository\nhere.\nExamples of Mind, Brain, Behavior theses are here.\n2014\nSpectral Sparsification: The Barrier Method and its\nApplications\n\nMartin Camacho, Advisor: Jelani Nelson\n\nGood Advice Costs Nothing and it’s Worth the Price: Incentive\nCompatible Recommendation Mechanisms for Exploring Unknown\nOptions\n\nPerry Green, Advisor: Yiling Chen\n\nBetter than PageRank: Hitting Time as a Reputation\nMechanism\n\nBrandon Liu, Advisor: David Parkes\n\nTree adjoining grammar at the\ninterfaces\n\nNicholas Longenbaugh, Advisor: Stuart Shieber\n\nSCHUBOT: Machine Learning Tools for the Automated Analysis of\nSchubert’s\nLieder\n\nDylan Nagler, Advisor: Ryan Adams\n\nLearning over Molecules: Representations and\nKernels\n\nJimmy Sun, Advisor: Ryan Adams\n\nTowards the Quantum Machine: Using Scalable Machine Learning Methods\nto Predict Photovoltaic Efficacy of Organic\nMolecules\n\nMichael Tingley, Advisor: Ryan Adams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard John A.

The ranges given here depend on whether the student starts mathematics at the Mathematics 1a, Mathematics 1b, or Mathematics 21a level. (With good planning it is also possible to earn a Computer Science degree starting with Mathematics Ma.) For example, a basic concentration requires 48 credits (12 courses), of which Mathematics 1a and/or Mathematics 1b can be waived, depending on placement, to reduce the number to 44 or 40 credits (11 or 10 courses).\nIn all of the requirements below, a student may replace a course with another course covering the same material at a more advanced level. For example, Mathematics 21b can be replaced with Mathematics 25a. For information on which courses are considered acceptable replacement, see our website or ask the Directors of Undergraduate Studies.\nNo student may reduce concentration requirements by omitting any other course other than Mathematics 1a or Mathematics 1b: any other required course not taken must be replaced by a similar course at a more advanced level.\nThe four concentration options share the following common requirement structure.\n\nBasic mathematics\nBasic software\nTheory\nTechnical electives (including the breadth requirement)\n\nBasic Requirements: 10-12 courses (40-48 credits)\n\nRequired courses:\n\nBasic Mathematics (2-4 courses):\n\nMathematics 1a and Mathematics 1b, if needed as preparation.\nLinear algebra: Any one of Mathematics 21b, Applied Mathematics 22a, Applied Mathematics 21b, Mathematics 23a, Mathematics 25a, or Mathematics 55a, or a more advanced linear algebra course.\nProbability/statistics or Multivariable calculus: One of the following. Either Statistics 110 or a more advanced probability or statistics course, or one of Mathematics 21a, Applied Mathematics 22b, Applied Mathematics 21a, Mathematics 23b, Mathematics 23c, Mathematics 25b, Mathematics 55b, or a more advanced multivariable calculus or analysis course.\nNote: Please contact the Directors of Undergraduate Studies for more information about the Mathematics 22 series.\nNote: Students that take all three of a linear algebra course, multivariate calculus course and probability/statistics course can count the probability/statistics course as a technical elective (see below).\n\n\nBasic Software (2 courses):  Two out of the following three courses: Computer Science 50, Computer Science 51, and Computer Science 61. Students who take all three courses may count one of Computer Science 51 or Computer Science 61 as a technical elective (see below). Ordinarily, CS 50 will not count for concentration credit after more advanced coursework.\nTheory (2 courses): Computer Science 121, plus any one additional theory course, including Computer Science courses numbered in the 120s and 220s, and Applied Mathematics 107. The recommended way to satisfy the theory requirement is to take both Computer Science 121 and Computer Science 124.\nTechnical Electives (4 courses):  Courses may be drawn from the following list:\n\nComputer Science courses numbered greater than 50 (including 91r). A student who takes all three of Computer Science 50, Computer Science 51, and Computer Science 61 may count either Computer Science 51 or Computer Science 61 as a technical elective.\nStatistics 110 and 195; Computer Science 20; Mathematics 154; Applied Mathematics 106, 107, 120, and 121; at most one of Engineering Sciences 50, 52, or 54; Engineering Sciences 153 or Physics 123; Engineering Sciences 170 and 256; Applied Computation 221.\nMany—but not all—MIT “Course 6” courses can be used as technical electives. Consult the DUS before enrolling.\n\n\nBreadth Requirement: In order to ensure breadth in the program two of the four technical electives must be Computer Science courses from different course groupings from the following lists, as identified by the penultimate digit of the course number:\n\nNote: Computer Science courses with penultimate digit 0, 1, 2, and 9 are valid technical electives if not used to satisfy other concentration requirements, but do not contribute to the breadth requirement\n3: Economics and Computation (any course of the form CS13x or CS23x)\n4: Hardware and Networks (any course of the form CS14x or of the form CS24x. Physics 123 and Engineering Sciences 153 count in this group as well).\n5: Programming Languages (CS51 if counted as a technical elective, or any other course of the form CS15x or CS25x).\n6: Systems (CS61 if counted as a technical elective, or any other course of the form CS16x or CS26x)\n7: Graphics, Visualization, and User Interfaces (any course of the form CS17x or CS27x).\n8: Artificial Intelligence (any course of the form CS18x or CS28x).\n\n\n\n\nTutorial:  Optional. Available as Computer Science 91r. This course is repeatable, but may be taken at most twice for academic credit, and only one semester of Computer Science 91r may be counted toward concentration requirements. Students wishing to enroll in Computer Science 91r must file a project proposal to be signed by the student and the faculty supervisor and approved by the Directors of Undergraduate Studies. The project proposal form can be found on the Computer Science website.\nThesis: None.\nGeneral Examination: None\nOther Information:\n\nApproved courses:  With the approval of the Directors of Undergraduate Studies, courses other than those listed above may be used to satisfy requirements. If a course is cross-listed with another department it meets the same requirements for the concentration as the Computer Science numbered course. To satisfy any of the requirements  for Basic Mathematics, Basic Software, and/or Theory, a substituted course must be in the same area of mathematics or computer science but more advanced than the stipulated course. Students must secure advance approval for course substitutions by filing a Plan of Study to be approved by the Directors of Undergraduate Studies. The Plan of Study form and a description of the process to submit the form can be found on the Computer Science website.\nPass/Fail and Sat/Unsat:  None of the courses used to satisfy concentration requirements may be taken Pass/Fail. Computer Science 50 will count for concentration credit if it is taken for a grade of SAT.\nCredit for prior work:  Except for Math 1ab, there is no reduction in concentration requirements for prior work. As noted in Basic Software above, students who skip CS50 must take both CS51 and CS61. Rarely, students wish, on the basis of prior experience, to skip CS51 or CS61 or courses such as Math 21a or Math 21b. They may be allowed to do so, with the prior approval of the Directors of Undergraduate Studies, if they substitute a more advanced course of the same kind: for example, CS152 in place of CS51, CS161 in place of CS61, Math 112 or Applied Math 105 in place of Math 21a, and Math 121 or Applied Math 120 in place of Math 21b.\nPlans of study:  Concentrators must file a Plan of Study showing how they intend to satisfy these degree requirements, and keep their plan of study up to date until their program is complete. If the plan is acceptable, the student will be notified that it has been approved. To petition for an exception to any rule, the student should file a new plan of study and notify the Directors of Undergraduate Studies of the rationale for any exceptional conditions. Approval of a plan of study is the student’s guarantee that a given set of courses will satisfy degree requirements. The Plan of Study form and a description of the process to submit the form can be found on the Computer Science website.\n\n\n\nRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12-14 courses (48-56 credits)\n\nRequired courses:\n\nBasic Mathematics (2-4 courses):  Same as Basic Requirements.\nBasic Software (2 courses): Same as Basic Requirements.\nTheory (2 courses): Same as Basic Requirements.\nTechnical Electives (6 courses):  6 courses from same list as  Basic Requirements.\nBreadth Requirement: For the honors track, three of the six technical electives must be Computer Science courses from different course groupings, as identified by the penultimate digit of the course number (see  Basic Requirements  for list of areas and restrictions).\n\n\nTutorial:  Same as Basic Requirements.\nThesis:  Optional but encouraged. See honors requirements on the Computer Science website. Students writing theses are often enrolled in Computer Science 91r. This course is repeatable, but may be taken at most twice for academic credit, and only one semester of Computer Science 91r may be counted toward concentration requirements. Students wishing to enroll in Computer Science 91r must file a project proposal to be signed by the student and the faculty supervisor and approved by the Directors of Undergraduate Studies. The project proposal form can be found on the Computer Science website.\nGeneral Examination: None.\nOther information:\n\nApproved courses:  Same as  Basic Requirements.\nPass/Fail and Sat/Unsat:  Same as  Basic Requirements.\nCredit for prior work:  Same as  Basic Requirements.\nPlans of Study:  Same as  Basic Requirements.\n\n\n\nRequirements for Joint Concentrations: 36-44 credits for CS field (9-11 courses for CS field)\nJoint concentrations with certain other fields are possible. This option is intended for students who have interests in the intersection of two fields, not simply in the two fields independently; for example, a combined concentration in computer science and linguistics might be appropriate for a student with a special interest in computational linguistics. Course requirements are the same as for the Requirements for Honors Eligibility, except that only three technical electives are required. These three technical electives must satisfy the breadth requirement as stated in Breadth Requirement, with the further provision that one semester of Computer Science 91r may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement for joint concentrations. Such courses may also be double-counted towards the requirements of the other field. Joint concentrations are not “double majors.” Joint concentrators should be interested in the overlap between two fields, not simply in both. A thesis in the intersection of the fields is required for joint concentrators, read by both concentrations. The student is typically awarded the minimum honors recommended by the two concentrations separately. These requirements, including the thesis requirement, are the same whether Computer Science is the primary field or the allied field of the joint concentration. Students interested in combined programs should consult the Directors of Undergraduate Studies at an early date and should work carefully with both concentrations to ensure all deadlines and requirements of both concentrations are met. Students with separate interests in more than one field should consider a secondary rather than a joint concentration, or simply using some of their electives to study one of the fields. We advise all our joint concentrators to make sure that they satisfy the non-joint requirements for at least one concentration, in case they are unable to complete a thesis.\nThe Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program\nStudents interested in addressing questions of neuroscience and cognition from the perspective of computer science may pursue a special program of study affiliated with the University-wide Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative, that allows them to participate in a variety of related activities. (Similar programs are available through the Anthropology, History and Science, Human Evolutionary Biology, Linguistics, Neurobiology, Philosophy, and Psychology concentrations.) Requirements for this honors-only program are based on those of the computer science Requirements for Honors Eligibility, as explained below:\nRequirements for Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program: 12-14 courses (48-56 credits)\n\nRequired courses:\n\nBasic Mathematics (2-4 courses): Same as Honors Requirements.\nBasic Software (2 courses): Same as Honors Requirements.\nTheory (2 courses): Same as Honors Requirements, except that Statistics 110 may count towards the second theory course. Statistics 110 is an option for the theory requirement only in the MBB track.\nTechnical Electives (4 courses):\n\nMCB 80 or MCB 81\nOne approved biology or psychology course\nAn approved MBB junior tutorial\nComputer Science 181, 182, or 183\n\n\nBreadth Requirement (2 courses): Two courses from different course groupings, identified by the penultimate digit of the course number (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) (see Basic Requirements for list of areas and restrictions). Group 8 is not an option for the breadth requirement in MBB programs, but Computer Science 91r may also be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. (SLS 20 is not an approved course for the Computer Science MBB track.)\n\n\nTutorial: Same as Honors Requirements.\nThesis: A computationally-oriented thesis on a Mind, Brain, and Behavior-related topic is required. Students pursuing thesis research may want to enroll in Computer Science 91r under Technical Electives.\nGeneral Examination: None.\nOther information:\n\nApproved courses:  Same as Honors Requirements.\nPass/Fail and Sat/Unsat:  Same as Honors Requirements.\nCredit for prior work:  Same as Honors Requirements.\nPlans of Study:  Same as Honors Requirements.\n\n\nNote: Students pursuing the Mind, Brain, and Behavior track are assigned an adviser in the field and are expected to participate in the University-wide Mind, Brain, and Behavior research milieu, including a non-credit senior year seminar for Mind, Brain, and Behavior thesis writers. To participate in the MBB track, students must both complete the Computer Science concentration Plan of Study and register at the beginning of every academic year on the MBB website. Interested students should contact the Computer Science liaison to the MBB program, Professor Stuart Shieber.\n\nTable of course substitutions for CS concentration\nThe following table summarizes some course substitutions that are allowed for the 2020 concentration requirements. It also includes the answers to some commonly asked questions about which courses satisfy certain requirements. If a course appears here as a valid substitution then you can use it in your plan of study instead of the original course. However, when you use a substitution, you should add a note saying so to the plan of study and mention it in your email to cs-dus submitting the plan of study. Courses change, and so can the allowed substitutions. If you have any question about a course that’s not listed here (or one that is) you can check with the DUSes. These substitutions are only valid for the computer science concentration. These substitutions are not valid for a secondary in CS, for which the requirements are listed here.\n\n\n\n\nCourse\nCan be used in place of\n\n\n\n\nMath 23b,23c, 25b, 55b, 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, AM 105, 108, and 111\nMath 21a: Multivariate Calculus\n\n\nMath 22b (Fall 2019 and after)\nMath 21a: Multivariate Calculus\n\n\nMath 23a, 25a, 55a,121,122, AM 120, 121\nMath 21b: Linear algebra\n\n\nMath 22a (Fall 2019 and after)\nMath 21b: Linear algebra\n\n\nAM 22a: Solving and Optimizing\nMath 21b: Linear algebra\n\n\nSTAT 185: Introduction to Dimension Reduction\nMath 21b: Linear algebra\n\n\nSTAT 210: Probability Theory and Statistical Inference I\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nSTAT 220: Bayesian Data Analysis\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nSTAT 111: Introduction to Statistical Inference\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nMath 154 Probability Theory\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nES 150: Introduction to Probability with Engineering Applications\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nSTAT S-110 (Summer course: intro to probability)\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nENSC S-138: (Summer course: intro to probability)\nSTAT 110: Probability\n\n\nCSCI S-20 (Summer course: intro to discrete math) (Currently Summer 2020 only)\nCS 20: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science\n\n\nCSCI S-50 (Summer course: intro to programming) (Currently Summer 2020 only)\nCS 50: Introduction to Computer Science\n\n\nCSCI S-111 (Summer course intro to programming)\nCS 50: Introduction to Computer Science\n\n\nMIT 6.849: Computational Geometry\nTech elective\n\n\nCS 1xx, 2xx\nTech elective, can satisfy breadth if penultimate digit 3-8\n\n\nCS 20: Discrete Mathematics\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nCS 91r: Supervised Reading and Research\nTech elective (one semester only)\n\n\nCS 96: System Design Projects\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nSTAT 110: Probability\nCan be used as tech elective (not breadth) if not used to satisfy probability requirement.\n\n\nAM 106: Applied Algebra\nTech elective (no breadth): as of fall 2018 cannot be used as second theory course\n\n\nAM 120: Applied linear algebra and big data\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nAM 121: Introduction to Optimization: Models and Methods\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nAM 216: Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nAM 231 (ES 201): Decision Theory\nTech elective (no breadth)\n\n\nSTAT 195: Statistical Machine Learning\nTech elective\n\n\nAPCOMP 221 Critical Thinking in Data Science\nTech elective (no breadth) -

over the Summer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n              CS91r\n            \nCS91r, Supervised Reading and Research, is a course for supervised\ninstruction of a individual student by a CS faculty member. It is a\nletter-graded course (i.e., you can not take it Pass/Fail or Sat/Unsat).\nThe CS Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) is the instructor\nofficially “offering” the course for registration purposes, but the\ncourse is supervised instruction of an individual student by an\nindividual faculty member. \nThe “r” in CS91r means that the course is repeatable. However, it can\nbe taken at most once for CS concentration credit, and at most\ntwice for degree credit.\nWho takes CS91r and why?\nCS91r is often taken by students writing a CS Senior Thesis, typically\nin their Senior Fall (when most of the work on their Senior Thesis\nhappens). It can, however, be taken at any time during a student’s\nundergraduate degree. \nOften a CS91r is a mechanism to enable a student to have sufficient time\nto work on research with a faculty member. But you don’t have to take a\nCS91r to be involved in research! You can do research over the summer,\nor during the semester.\nNote that per Harvard College\npolicy, you can\nnot receive academic credit for work for which you are financially\ncompensated. So you cannot be paid for research that will be part of a\nCS91r. \nWho can supervise a CS91r?\nThe CS91r supervisor is typically a CS faculty member.\nNon-CS faculty members are occasionally permitted to be CS91r\nsupervisors, but the student and the potential supervisor should contact\nthe CS DUS well in advance of the Course Registration deadline. While we\ngreatly appreciate the willingness of non-CS faculty to spend time and\nenergy supervising a CS student for a CS91r, we want to ensure that the\nstudent will have a suitable research experience, with appropriate\nsupervision. In particular, the CS91r should provide an opportunity for\nthinking like a researcher.  Even if the day-to-day activities of the\nproject are going to be mundane, the student should be able to\narticulate what new knowledge is being sought and how their particular\nresearch activity contributes to the big goal.\nHow do I sign up for a CS91r?\nPlease follow these steps.\n\n\nDownload the CS91r form.\n\n\nStudent fills out the top portion of the form.\n\n\nThe student and supervisor exchange the document electronically\nuntil both are satisfied with its description of the project and the\nbasis for evaluation. The project description should have a\nrecognizable research component.\n\n\nThe student “signs” at the bottom by typing his/her name and sends\nthe “signed” form to the supervisor.\n\n\nThe supervisor “signs” at the bottom by typing his/her name and\nemails the signed copy to cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu from the\nsupervisor’s official Harvard email address.\n\n\nThe student requests to enroll in CS91r via my.harvard.\n\n\nThe DUS will approve the student’s enrollment only upon receipt of\nthe signed form from the supervisor. Student and supervisor will\nboth receive copies of the completed document, “signed” by the\nDUS.\n\n\n \nCan I take CS 91r over the Summer?\nThe Summer School allows students to enroll in a 91r: Supervised Reading and Research Course. Computer Science will treat this the same way it would treat a CS 91r during the semester.\nMore information about this option is available at the Summer School Website.\nProcess for Summer School 91r:\n\n\nFollow the directions as above and have your advisor submit a completed CS 91r form to cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu no later than June 13, 2023.  We will review your petition and sign if approved.\n\n\nFill out the Summer School 91r Form with your advisor. CS-DUS will sign Section IV via email after the CS department’s form is approved.\n\n\nSubmit your completed Summer School 91r form, completed Summer School registration form, and tuition payment to the Summer School by June 16, 2022, as described on the Summer School 91r form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard John A.

and English honors (highest honors, high honors, honors) are determined by concentrations. More precisely, the Latin honors are: “summa cum laude in a field”, “magna cum laude with Highest Honors in a field”, “magna cum laude in a field”, “cum laude in a field”, and “cum laude on the basis of the student’s overall record”.\nEnglish Honors\nTo receive English honors in Computer Science, students must have a high\ngrade point average and must also fulfill a more demanding course\nprogram than the basic program.  There are several honors tracks within\nComputer Science (see the Computer Science handbook entry for more details):\n\n\nThe standard honors program requires two additional courses on top of the basic requirements, as well as greater depth in certain areas.  See this table as well as the handbook entry\nfor the details.\n\n\nJoint Concentrations and the Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program are also part of the honors track.  For a joint concentration, ultimately the primary field is responsible for the English honors recommendation.\n\n\nAll levels of English honors in Computer Science are decided individually by vote of the Computer Science faculty based on the\nstudent’s academic and scientific achievements. In making this determination, the faculty looks not only on the concentration GPA but also on the overall level of ambition in the course program. For high honors and highest honors a (strong) thesis is required as well.\nOrdinarily, honors in Computer Science requires a concentration GPA of at least 3.5 in the courses on the student’s Computer Science study plan; high honors in\nComputer Science requires a concentration GPA of at least 3.75 and an excellent thesis; and highest honors in Computer Science requires a concentration GPA of at least 3.85 and an outstanding thesis.\nLatin Honors\nLatin honors are awarded by the college based on students' overall GPA as well as recommendations from the concentration.\nThe Harvard College Handbook for Students contains the official requirements for Latin honors, which are summarized here:\n\n\nSumma cum laude in a field:\n\nHighest Honors from concentration\nTop 5% of graduating class drawn from those designated for Highest Honors\n\n\n\nMagna cum laude:\n\nNo more than 20% of graduating class can receive summa or magna\n“Magna cum laude with Highest Honors in a field” requires Highest Honors from concentration\n“Magna cum laude in a field” requires High Honors from concentration\n\n\n\nCum laude in a field:\n\nHonors, High Honors, or Highest Honors from concentration\nNo more than 50% of graduating class can receive summa, magna, or cum\n\n\n\nCum laude on the basis of the student’s overall record:\n\nGPA above the magna cutoff, up to at most 10% of graduating class\n(No English honors.)\n\n\n\nHistorical data\nHere is historical data on the GPA threshholds established by the Faculty for awarding degrees Magna Cum Laude and Cum Laude in Field.
